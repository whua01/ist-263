                <br>ACL Surgery Recovery Tips<br>
                Being proactive in your recovery may help you heal as quickly as possible, experience less pain, and return more quickly to your previous activity level.
    
                Be Patient During Physical Therapy
                It can be tempting, especially for athletes, to push your body to the limit when doing physical therapy. Although it is important to perform the recommended strengthening and stretching exercises, doing too much too soon can actually slow down the recovery process. Follow your physical therapistâ€™s recommendations about which exercises are appropriate and how much you can do. If you think you can do more, check with your physical therapist before attempting to go further.
                Use Cold Therapy to Control Inflammation
                Pain and swelling are at their peak in the first week after ACL surgery.1 It is especially important to apply cold therapy during this period to help reduce swelling and naturally control pain. Adding active compression with a cold therapy device may further reduce swelling by helping your body pump away excess fluid and enabling the cold to penetrate deeper for a longer-lasting therapeutic effect.5 Continuing to use cold therapy for the duration of your recovery may help promote healing and control any pain and swelling you might experience after physical therapy sessions.
    
                So how long will you be on crutches after surgery? It depends on a number of factors, but if you are proactive about accelerating the healing process, you may be off crutches as soon as two weeks after surgery.
