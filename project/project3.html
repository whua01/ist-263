        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Injuries to the ACL are relatively common knee injuries among athletes.[1] They occur most frequently in those who play sports involving pivoting (e.g. football, basketball, netball, soccer, European team handball, gymnastics, downhill skiing). They can range from mild (such as small tears/sprain) to severe (when the ligament is completely torn). Both contact and non-contact injuries can occur, although non-contact tears and ruptures are most common. It appears that females tend to have a higher incidence rate of ACL injury than males, that being between 2.4 and 9.7 times higher in female athletes competing in similar activities.

        <h2>Clinically Relevant Anatomy</h2>
        <p>
            The ACL is a band of dense connective tissue which courses from the femur to the tibia. It is considered as a key structure in the knee joint, as it resists anterior tibial translation and rotational loads.

            The ACL arises from the posteromedial corner of the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle in the intercondylar notch and inserted anterior to the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia, blending with the anterior horn of the medial meniscus. The ACL courses anteriorly, medially, and distally across the joint as it passes from the femur to the tibia. As it does, it turns on itself in a slight outward (lateral) spiral.

            There are two components of the ACL, the smaller anteromedial bundle (AMB) and the larger posterolateral bundle (PLB), named according to where the bundles insert into the tibial plateau. When the knee is extended the PLB is tight and the AMB is moderately lax. However, as the knee is flexed, the femoral attachment of the ACL assumes a more horizontal orientation, causing the AMB to tighten and the PLB to loosen and thus leave the AMB as the restraint to anterior tibial load.

        <h4>Mechanisms of Injury</h4>
        <p>
            Three major types of ACL injuries are described:<br>
            Direct Contact: 30% of the cases.<br>
            Indirect Contact.<br>
            Non-Contact: 70% of the cases: by doing a wrong movement.
            Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common in young individuals who participate in sports activities associated with pivoting, decelerating and jumping.
            Most common are the non-contact injuries caused by forces generated within the athleteâ€™s body. While, most other sport injuries involve a transfer of energy from an external source. Approximately 75% of ruptures are sustained with minimal or no contact at the time of injury.
            A cut-and-plant movement is the typical mechanism that causes the ACL to tear, being a sudden change in direction or speed with the foot firmly planted. Rapid deceleration moments, including those that also involve planting the affected leg to cut and change direction, have also been linked to ACL injuries, as well as landing from a jump, pivoting, twisting, and direct impact to the front of the tibia
            Women are three times more prone to have the ACL injured than men and is thought to be due to the following reasons:<br>
            1.Smaller size and different shape of the intercondylar notch: A narrow intercondylar notch and a plateau environment are risk factors of predisposing female non-athletes with knee OA to ACL injury aged 41-65 years.<br>
            2.Wider pelvis and greater Q angle: A wider pelvis requires the femur to have a greater angle towards the knee, lesser muscle strength provides less knee support, and hormonal variations may alter the laxity of ligaments.<br>
            3.Greater ligament laxity: Young athletes with non-modifiable risk factors like ligament laxity are at a particularly increased risk of recurrent injury following ACL reconstruction (ACLR).<br>
            4.Shoe surface interface: The pooled data from the three studies suggest that the chances of injury are approximately 2.5 times higher when higher levels of rotational traction are present at the shoe-surface interface<br>
            5.Neuromuscular factors.<br>
            6.The mechanism of ACL injury may differ in females especially with respect to the dynamic positioning of the knee, as females demonstrate greater valgus collapse of the LE primarily in the coronal plane.

        <h5>Risk Factors</h5>
        <p>
            Risk factors for ACL injuries include environmental factors (e.g. high level of friction between shoes and the playing surface) and anatomical factors (e.g. narrow femoral intercondylar notch). The injury is characterized by joint instability, which is associated with both acute dysfunction and long-term degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis and meniscal damage.
            Knee instability leads to decreased activity, which can lead to poor knee-related quality of life. The risk factors for ACL injury have been considered as either internal or external to an individual. External risk factors include type of competition, footwear and surface, and environmental conditions. Internal risk factors include anatomical, hormonal and neuromuscular risk factors.
