        <h6>ACL Surgery Recovery Timeline</h6>
        <img src="../project/wk12project1.jpeg" class="img1" alt="picture about acl recovery">
        <p>
            Although every individual is different, you can expect the following rough timeline for ACL surgery recovery<br>
            he First 2 Weeks After Surgery
            his is a critical time during the recovery process because it is when your body is most vulnerable. Surgery is a traumatic experience for your muscles, ligaments, and other tissues, which is why the body responds with inflammation. During the period immediately after surgery, you may experience pain, swelling, and the buildup of excess fluid around the knee joint. The rehabilitation process starts right after the surgery, and you may be given exercises that must be performed daily to support your recovery. During this time, your ability to bear weight on the affected leg may be limited, so plan on using crutches and limiting your mobility for at least 10 days.<br>
            Rehabilitation tips to try:<br>
            Elevate the leg, and apply therapeutic cold every two hours.<br>
            Place the leg over the edge of a bed or chair for knee flexion.<br>
            Place a prop under the heel when straight for knee extension.<br>
            Do gait training to prepare for removal of crutches.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>2-6 Weeks After Surgery<br>
            You may be able to bear weight on both legs during this time, but activity may still be limited as your tissues are actively healing. Depending on the type of car you drive, your medication use, and which leg is injured, you might also be able to resume driving during this time. Your physical therapist will focus on helping you regain full range of motion. Because your knee is still vulnerable at this stage, you may have to wear a protective brace to protect it from unnecessary stress
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>Rehabilitation tips to try<br>
            Perform walking exercises for 15- to 20-minute intervals.<br>
            Do leg strengthening exercises such as squats, leg presses, and hamstring curls if advised by your PT.<br>
            Add stationary bicycle and elliptical training.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>6 Weeks to 3 Months After Surgery<br>
            As the healing process progresses and your knee continues to grow stronger, you may be allowed to do more low-impact activities such as cycling, swimming, and rowing. By the end of this period, you may be able to resume light jogging if your physical therapist thinks you are ready.
            Rehabilitation tips to try<br>

            Perform lateral training exercises such as lunges and side steps.
            Do flutter-style swimming strokes.
            Avoid cutting or pivoting motions.
            Continue strength exercises, and begin sport-specific training.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>3-6 Months After Surgery<br>
            During this time, you may be more eager to return to sports. Your physical therapist may recommend sport-specific activities to help you prepare for your return. He or she might also show you ongoing exercises that may help protect the ACL and help prevent future injury. A knee brace may be recommended during this period, even for low-impact activities.

            Rehabilitation tips to try:<br>

            Slowly return to running activities.
            Introduce jumping and agility training.
            Work toward single-leg plyometric exercises.
            After six months, assuming your damaged tissues have fully healed, you can return to athletic activity. Some doctors recommend the use of a supportive brace for 1-2 years after ACL surgery.
